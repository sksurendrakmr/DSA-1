/**
 * Big O is a way of comparing two sets of code.
 * It's a way to compare codes mathematically. About how efficient they run.
 *
 * Time Complexity (Not measured based on time...ðŸ¤”ðŸ¥º)
 * It is measured in the number of operations that it takes to complete something.
 *
 * Space Complexity
 * E.g. Let's say code one runs very fast, but it takes up a lot of memory when it runs and
 * maybe code 2, even though it takes much longer to finish, maybe it takes up less memory.
 *
 * So, if preserving memory space is the most important priority, and we don't mind having
 * some extra time complexity than code 2 is better.
